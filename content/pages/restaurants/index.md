As single iOS developer I worked on Afisha Restaurants iOS app. Afisha is the leading internet and offline media resource about lifestyle (restaurants, cinema, theatre, museums, travelling), music and everything else happening in Moscow and other cities of Russia. Afisha Restaurants app is a mobile guide of best Moscow restaurants powered by Afisha restaurants database. It provides full information about restaurants, user ratings and reviews as well as professional reviews by Afisha editors.

Working on this project I developed flexible and maintainable application architecture and took part in designing server API. I intensively used various design patterns, storyboards, autolayout, tools like CocoaPods and Parse Push Notifications and other modern technologies.
