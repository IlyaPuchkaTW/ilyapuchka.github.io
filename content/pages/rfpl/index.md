title: RFPL, UEFA Champions League, UEFA Europa League apps
---

2012

These three similar applications were developed by me as a solo iOS developer. All source code was written by me from scratch.

Features:

- **live/VOD broadcasting (via custom AVPlayer and HLS)**
- **in app purchases**
- **push notifications**
- **users authentication**
- **offline mode (via Core Data)**

What frameworks and technologies I used:  
CoreData (local storage), AVFoundation (video player), AFNetworking, Push Notifications, StoreKit, Google Analytics iOS SDK, Facebook SDK, Twitter OAuth API, Git submodules

Currenly these applications are not avaliable in App Store for reasons beyond my control. But you can check out an application, built on top of them - [Football Plus](https://itunes.apple.com/ru/app/futbol-plus/id661579560?mt=8)
