Hi there!

My name is Ilya and I'm iOS developer from Moscow, Russia. Nice to meet you!

I began to develop for iOS in 2011 soon after iPad release in Russia. Back then I was working in [CoolConnections](http://www.coolconnections.ru) where I was responsible for technical support and organization of different cinema events. Therefore I've desided to create [iOS app for 35mm cinema hall](/35mm) which we were managing.

In march 2012 I've decided to become professional iOS developer and started to work in [Denivip Media](http://blog.denivip.ru/). The company specialised on creating video streaming platforms. There I've developed [few apps](/rfpl) for live & vod streaming of football games. Later I was working on some startups of the company.

When I felt that I want to move further I got into [Mail.ru](http://corp.mail.ru/). There I was working on mobile ads framework for applications cross-promo and Target@Mail platform.

Since May 2014 till March 2015 I worked as Senior iOS developer in [Rambler&Co](http://www.rambler-co.ru). Our mobile team works on almost every mobile application for holding's projects, such as Afisha, Afisha-Eda, Afisha-Mir, Championat.com, Redigo, and all new applications like [Afisha-Restaurants](/restaurants).

In April 2015 I moved to Berlin and started as an iOS developer in Sync Engine team at [Wire](https://www.wire.com) in Berlin. Check out their [open source](https://github.com/wireapp) to see what I was working on. Then I moved on to [HelloFresh](http://www.hellofresh.com) where I stayed for two years and was an iOS chapter lead in on of the most product oriented squads. I still got credits for [this small app](https://github.com/ilyapuchka/HFWeekApp) I hacked together there in early days.

And currently I'm based in London and working here for [babylon](https://www.babylonhealth.com).
